# Trading Strategy Requirements Analysis

## Strategy Options

### 1. Momentum Trading
- **Description**: Capitalizes on the continuation of existing market trends
- **Key Indicators**: 
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Rate of Change (ROC)
  - Volume-weighted indicators
- **Implementation Considerations**:
  - Entry signals based on trend strength indicators
  - Exit strategies to capture profit before trend reversal
  - Timeframe selection critical for effectiveness
  - Works best in trending markets with clear directional movement

### 2. Mean Reversion
- **Description**: Based on the concept that prices tend to revert to their historical mean
- **Key Indicators**:
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Standard deviation channels
  - Z-score of price
  - Statistical arbitrage metrics
- **Implementation Considerations**:
  - Identification of overbought/oversold conditions
  - Statistical validation of mean and boundaries
  - Risk of "catching falling knives" in strong trends
  - Works best in range-bound, oscillating markets

### 3. Breakout Strategies
- **Description**: Identifies and trades significant price movements through support/resistance levels
- **Key Indicators**:
  - Price channels
  - Support/resistance levels
  - Volume confirmation
  - Volatility measurements
- **Implementation Considerations**:
  - False breakout filtering mechanisms
  - Confirmation requirements (time, volume, etc.)
  - Dynamic support/resistance identification
  - Works best during market transitions and high-impact news events

### 4. Machine Learning-based Predictive Models
- **Description**: Uses statistical learning to identify patterns and predict future price movements
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Supervised learning (regression, classification)
  - Feature engineering from technical indicators
  - Time series forecasting models
  - Ensemble methods for robustness
- **Implementation Considerations**:
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model training, validation, and testing protocols
  - Overfitting prevention
  - Computational efficiency for real-time prediction

## Risk Management Techniques

### 1. Position Sizing
- Kelly Criterion implementation
- Percentage of equity approach
- Volatility-adjusted position sizing
- Maximum position limits

### 2. Stop-Loss Mechanisms
- Fixed percentage stops
- ATR-based dynamic stops
- Time-based stops
- Volatility-adjusted stops

### 3. Take-Profit Strategies
- Fixed R-multiple targets
- Trailing stops for trend following
- Partial profit taking at predetermined levels
- Time-based profit taking

### 4. Risk Exposure Controls
- Maximum drawdown limits
- Correlation-based portfolio constraints
- Maximum open positions limit
- Daily/weekly loss limits

### 5. Market Condition Filters
- Volatility filters
- Liquidity assessment
- Trading hour restrictions
- Economic calendar event filters

## Performance Metrics for Strategy Selection

- Stress testing

## Security and Compliance

### 1. API Security
- Secure credential storage
- API key rotation policies
- Access control mechanisms
- Connection encryption

### 2. Trading Compliance
- Order frequency limits
- Market manipulation prevention
- Regulatory reporting capabilities
- Audit trail maintenance

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Alert systems
- Failover procedures

## Implementation Priorities
1. Robust API integration with comprehensive error handling
2. Backtesting framework for strategy evaluation
3. Core strategy implementations with performance metrics
